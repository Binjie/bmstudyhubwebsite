## How to Play

1. **Watch** – Gray squares will briefly light up in a sequence (one by one).  
2. **Repeat** – Click the squares in the **exact same order**.  
3. **Progress** – Each correct round adds one more step to the sequence.  
4. **Fail?** – The game ends. Try to beat your longest sequence!

## Why Train Spatial Memory?

Spatial memory is crucial for:

- **Navigation** – Remembering routes and locations.  
- **STEM learning** – Visualizing geometry, diagrams, and 3D structures.  
- **Everyday tasks** – Packing, organizing, and recalling where things are.  

This grid‑based task is a digital version of the classic **Corsi block‑tapping test**, a widely used neuropsychological assessment.

## Tips for Improvement

- **Chunking** – Mentally group squares into patterns (L‑shape, diagonal).  
- **Verbal coding** – Silently name positions (e.g., “top‑left, center”).  
- **Pacing** – Don’t rush; accuracy is more important than speed.  
- **Gradual increase** – Start with 3×3 and short sequences, then increase grid size.

## Difficulty Levels

| Grid Size | Cells | Best for          |
|-----------|-------|-------------------|
| 3×3       | 9     | Beginners         |
| 4×4       | 16    | Standard          |
| 5×5       | 25    | Advanced          |
| 6×6       | 36    | Expert / Challenge |

*Initial sequence length is always 3. After each correct recall, the sequence grows by one.*
