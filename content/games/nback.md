## How to Play Dual N-Back

Dual N-Back is one of the most scientifically validated working memory training tasks. You need to track two streams of information simultaneously and decide whether the **current stimulus matches the one presented N steps ago**.

1. **Visual Channel** – A blue square appears in one of 8 positions on a 3×3 grid.  
2. **Auditory Channel** – A letter (A–H) is spoken at the same time.  

Your goal: press **'A'** if the *position* matches the one N steps back, press **'L'** if the *letter* matches, and press **'Both'** (or the spacebar) if both match.  

No response is required if there is no match.

> ⚡ **Start with 2-back** – it's the standard version. Adjust the N value in the game settings below.

## Why Train with N-Back?

Research suggests that dual n-back training can lead to:

- **Increased working memory capacity** – hold and manipulate more information at once.  
- **Improved fluid intelligence** – the ability to solve novel problems independent of acquired knowledge.  
- **Better focus and attention control** – filter out distractions and maintain concentration.

## Tips for Best Results

- **Consistency over intensity**: 15–20 minutes per day, 4–5 days per week yields the best transfer.  
- **Increase difficulty gradually**: Once you reach 80% accuracy on both channels, move to the next N level.  
- **Dual task is the key**: Don’t ignore one channel – train both equally.  
- **Take breaks**: If you feel mental fatigue, rest for a few minutes.

## Difficulty Progression

| N‑Level | Description              | Target Accuracy (both channels) |
|---------|--------------------------|---------------------------------|
| 1‑back  | Immediate repetition     | ≥ 90%                           |
| 2‑back  | Classic dual task        | ≥ 80%                           |
| 3‑back  | Moderate load            | ≥ 70%                           |
| 4‑back  | High load                | ≥ 60%                           |
| 5‑back  | Expert level             | ≥ 50%                           |

*Aim to complete at least 20 trials per session to get meaningful training.*
