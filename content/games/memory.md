## How to Play

1. **Memorize**: Watch symbols appear in numbered order (#1, #2, #3...)
2. **Recall**: Click cards in the same numbered order
3. **Improve**: Track your score and accuracy as you progress

## Why It Works

Sequential memory training strengthens your brain's ability to:
- Remember multi-step instructions
- Follow procedures in correct order
- Improve working memory capacity

## Tips for Success

- **Create associations**: Link numbers to symbols (#1⭐ = "One star")
- **Make stories**: Create a narrative with symbols in order
- **Practice daily**: Short, consistent sessions work best
- **Progress gradually**: Start with 4 items, advance when ready
